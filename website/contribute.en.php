	The KDE-ga translation centre can be found on the KDE <a href="http://i18n.kde.org/team-infos.php?teamcode=ga" target="_blank">Irish translation</a> page.
	<br>
	<br>	
	The current status of the Irish Gaelic translation can be seen on its <a href="http://i18n.kde.org/stats/gui/stable-kde4/team/ga/" target="_blank">statistics</a> page. As you will see, the core libraries (kdelibs and kde-runtime) are completely translated, along with many other applications. Any strings that have not been translated appear in English by default.
	<br>
	<br>
	The KDE-ga translation team is headed by Kevin Scannell (kscanne@gmail.com).  Past contributors include Sean Kelley and Séamus Ó Ciardhuáin.
